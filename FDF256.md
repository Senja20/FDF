# FDF256 

The Flickr Diverse Faces 256 (FDF256) dataset is a derivate from 248,564 images from the YFCC100M dataset, following the dataset generation of the original FDF dataset.
The training dataset consists of 241,982 images and the validation set of 6533 images, where each face is up/downsampled to $256 \times 256$.
We filter out all faces where the original resolution is smaller than $64 \times 64$.
Each face is annotated with keypoints from a pre-trained keypoint R-CNN R50-FPN from torchvision, and the bounding box is from the official implementation of DSFD.


## Licenses
The images are collected from images in the YFCC-100M dataset and each image in our dataset is free to use for **academic** or **open source** projects. For each face, the corresponding original license is given in the metadata.
Some of the images require giving proper credit to the original author, as well as indicating any changes that were made to the images. The original author is given in the metadata.

## Privacy
FDF consists of photos that are published for free use and redistribution by the respective authors.

To find out if your photo is included in FDF256: we have included a script to search the dataset with your flickr User NSID.

To check if your user is included, run the script:
```
python3 search_username.py data/fdf256/train/fdf_metainfo.json --user_nsid=FLICKR_USER_NSID
```
The script will print all images that where published with the given user nsid.

To get your photo removed from FDF:

1. Go to Flickr and do one of the following:
    - Tag the photo with `no_cv` to indicate that you do not wish it to be used for computer vision research.
    - Change the license of the photo to `None` (All rights reserved) or any Creative Commons license with `NoDerivs` to indicate that you do not want it to be redistributed.
    - Make the photo private, i.e., only visible to you and your friends/family.
    - Get the photo removed from Flickr altogether.
2. Contact [hakon.hukkelas@ntnu.no](mailto:hakon.hukkelas@ntnu.no). Include your flicker User NSID in the mail.
